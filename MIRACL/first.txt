MIRACL is a highly efficient and portable Multiprecision Integer and Rational 
Arithmetic C/C++ Library. Full source code is provided. Its main area of 
application is in the implementation of Public Key Cryptography systems and
protocols. Many example programs are provide. 

The MIRACL library can be used freely for Academic, non-profit making or 
non-commercial use. Commercial Users must register.

The term "commercial use" means any for-profit use of the MIRACL library.
Any commercial use of MIRACL requires a license which may be obtained from
Shamus Software Ltd

Single user license 1,000 euro for first developer/workstation.
Per additional user 500 euro
Server license 5,000
Updates are free.

LICENSE TYPES

Single user license
MIRACL is installed and used on one single machine, which may not be used as
a server.

Server license
MIRACL is installed and used on one server machine and there is no limit on
the number of clients.

When buying any kind of license, you have the right to install and to
develop your own programs using MIRACL. You are also allowed to sell the
binaries of your own programs that have been compiled using MIRACL. There
are no runtime royalties. All licenses are non-exclusive.
If you sell software that was developed using MIRACL, there is no
requirement to cite MIRACL.

Redistributing your copy of MIRACL to a third party is not allowed.
A commercial license for the installation and use of MIRACL is always given
for one machine. Installing or copying the software to another machine is
not allowed.

To access the software, download the file miracl.zip.

If using Windows decompress all files into a single DOS directory MIRACL

To build the standard library in this directory using the Microsoft compiler, 
first make sure that paths are set up correctly by running the Microsoft 
supplied batch files vcvars32 or vcvars64 (for 32-bit or 64-bit environments 
respectively), or vcvarsall <param> to set up a named environment

Then execute either ms32doit.bat or ms64doit.bat (for 32-bit or 64-bit builds resp.)


If using Linux, read the following carefully


------------------------------------------------
RedHat Linux 6.0 MIRACL i386 installation

Download the MIRACL.ZIP file, and save it into an otherwise empty MIRACL directory.

1. Unzip the MIRACL.ZIP file using the unix utility unzip

unzip -j -aa -L miracl.zip

The -j ignores the directory structure inside MIRACL.ZIP. The -aa converts all 
text files to Unix format, and -L ensures that all filenames are lower-case.


2. Perform a tailored build of the MIRACL library by opening an X-Term, and 
   typing

bash linux

   Alternatively if your system is 64-bit

bash linux64

3. All the MIRACL applications (except RATCALC) can be then be built, as 
   desired. Remember to link all C applications to the miracl.a library.
   C++ applications must be linked as well to one or more of big.o monty.o 
   elliptic.o crt.o flash.o object files etc. 
   Some applications (like factor.c) that require floating-point support 
   may also require -lm in the compile command line.

Make sure that your Linux PATH points to the current directory, so that 
exectables can be run.

Note that Linux already has (a rather pathetic) factor program. To avoid name 
clashes you might rename MIRACL's "factor" program to "facter", or somesuch.
